In this Computational Practicum, I provide a piece of software that estimates a solution for a given First order Differential equations using 4 famous numerical methods. The numerical solutions are then compared to the exact solution found previously thanks to analytical techniques.
This piece of software is written in Java. The Graphical user interface is created using the JavaFx Library.
The code follows the SOLID design principles, Object Oriented Programming best practices as well as JavaDoc conventions.
